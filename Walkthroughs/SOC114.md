## Main Investigation
Is the mail content suspicious?: For this, I headed on to the Email Security dashboard on Letsdefend and searched for the email that was sent from accounting@cmail.carleton.ca to richard@letsdefend.io on Jan, 31st 2021, at 3:48 PM.

The first thing I noticed was the text in the body of the email was very short and the products bought were not specified which would definitely make the user download the attachment in the email. The second thing I noticed was the name of the attachment (c9ad9506bcccfaa987ff9fc11b91698d) which looks suspicious.
I proceeded to analyze this attachment on Hybrid-Analysis (An online malware analysis sandbox) to check if the file was malicious.

Hybrid-Analysis ResultFrom the result I got from hybrid-analysis the file was flagged as malicious threat score was 100/100 which is bad. 
Going through the result from the Scan I saw the file (which is a zip file) bundled with another .xlsx file called 44e65a641fb970031c5efed324676b5018803e0a768608d3e186152102615795.xlsx which was labelled as CVE-2017–11882 which is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2007 Service Pack 3, Microsoft Office 2010 Service Pack 2, Microsoft Office 2013 Service Pack 1, and Microsoft Office 2016 which  allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in the context of the current user by failing to properly handle objects in memory, aka "Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability".

I then analyzed the hash of the .xlsx file (44e65a641fb970031c5efed324676b5018803e0a768608d3e186152102615795) on virus total which also flagged the file as malicious.

![Virustotal result](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50ba63f5-1982-47c8-a10c-b0513952c950)

In Virustotal I went through the details of the file and found that it dropped some files and also contacted a URL (HTTP[:]//www[.]andaluciabeach[.]net/image/network[.]exe ) which was also flagged as malicious.

After all my analysis I still couldn't jump to the conclusion that the email was malicious so I proceeded to scan the STMP Address (49.234.43.39) on virus total which reported the address as malicious.

![IP Address Reputation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4edc9bbe-07d2-4617-9ef6-46b76943bbbe)

Going through the whois details of the virus total scan of the address I found that the belongs to Tencent Cloud Computing in Beijing China.

![Whois Information](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30d035f3-7404-4013-afa0-0be7c19b7691)

Now if we remember the email came from accounting@cmail.carleton.ca 
So I copied the Domain address carleton.ca and scanned it on virus total which flagged the email as clean.

![Carleton.ca reputation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b958038-0850-41c4-865a-fc491d694488)

Now looking at the whois information of the Domain I found that it belonged to Carleton University which is in Ottawa Canada.
The STMP Address whois information and the domain whois are completely different which brought me to the conclusion that the email is malicious and the address was probably spoofed.

Was the mail delivered to the User in the alert details I was already able to see that the Device Action was allowed meaning the mail was delivered to the user.

Check if Someone opened the Malicious file/URL: To do this I headed on to the Log Management Dashboard on Letsdefend and searched for the C2 Address of the file which I got from virustotal. (HTTP[:]//www[.]andaluciabeach[.]net/image/network[.]exe ) and that the address was accessed and created a process called EQNEDT32.EXE.

## Conclusion
This analysis of the SOC114 alert on LetsDefend demonstrates how a seemingly harmless email with an attachment can be a cleverly disguised phishing attempt. The attacker used social engineering tactics, such as a generic email body and a suspicious attachment name, to try and trick the recipient into downloading malware.
Lessons Learned
Always Be Suspicious of Unsolicited Emails with Attachments: Don't automatically trust emails, especially those with attachments, even if they appear to come from a legitimate source.
Verify Sender Information: Check the sender's email address carefully, and be wary of inconsistencies between the domain name and the SMTP address.
Analyze Attachments Before Downloading: Utilize online malware analysis tools or sandboxes to scan attachments before opening them.
Maintain Updated Security Software: Regularly update antivirus and antimalware software to stay protected against the latest threats.
Implement Strong User Awareness Training: Educate users about phishing tactics and best practices for identifying and avoiding malicious emails.

## Other Steps to Take
Report the Phishing Attempt: Report the phishing attempt to the appropriate authorities or security teams to help prevent others from falling victim.
Change User Passwords: If the malicious email was successful in compromising a user account, reset the user's password immediately.
Investigate Further: Conduct a broader investigation to determine if any other systems were compromised by the attack.
